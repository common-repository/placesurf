== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* Why cant I see the map in the plugin screen?

You will need to register your wordpress domain (e.g myblog.com) to signup for the Google Maps API. You can still use the plugin without it by manually typing in the latitude/longitude but it is much easier to select from the map.


* Can the PlaceSurf plugin accept latitude/longitude in both of the common formats (decimal or degrees/minutes/seconds)?

Yes PlaceSurf should accept both formats without a problem.


* Will the PlaceSurf links work on my Iphone/Ipad?

Yes as long as Google Earth is installed on the device, PlaceSurf links will work.
